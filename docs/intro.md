# Introduction to ModelPack

Welcome to **ModelPack**, a CNCF Sandbox project dedicated to standardizing machine learning model packaging and distribution.

## What is ModelPack?

ModelPack provides a standardized format for packaging, distributing, and deploying machine learning models across different platforms and environments. It enables seamless integration with cloud-native infrastructure and supports models from any machine learning framework.

## Key Features

- **Standardized Format**: Consistent model packaging across all frameworks
- **Cloud Native**: Built for Kubernetes and CNCF ecosystem
- **Framework Agnostic**: Support for TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and more
- **Easy Distribution**: Simplified model sharing and deployment

## Getting Started

To get started with ModelPack, check out the [model-spec repository](https://github.com/modelpack/model-spec) on GitHub.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/modelpack/model-spec.git

# Follow the documentation to package your first model
cd model-spec
```
