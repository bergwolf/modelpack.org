# Introduction to ModelPack

Welcome to **ModelPack** - a specification for packaging and distributing AI models.

## What is ModelPack?

ModelPack is a CNCF Sandbox project that provides a standardized way to package, distribute, and deploy AI models across different platforms and environments. It builds on existing cloud-native technologies and follows best practices from the container ecosystem.

## Why ModelPack?

The AI/ML ecosystem lacks a standardized approach for packaging and distributing models. ModelPack addresses this by:

- **Standardization**: Providing a common format for AI model packaging
- **Interoperability**: Enabling models to work across different tools and platforms
- **Cloud Native**: Integrating with container registries and Kubernetes
- **Simplicity**: Making it easy to share and deploy models

## Key Features

- **OCI-Compatible**: Built on the Open Container Initiative (OCI) specification
- **Version Control**: Support for model versioning and tracking
- **Metadata Rich**: Comprehensive metadata for model description and discovery
- **Registry Support**: Compatible with existing container registries
- **Cross-Platform**: Works across different operating systems and cloud providers
