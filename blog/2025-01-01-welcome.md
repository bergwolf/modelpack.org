## What is ModelPack?

ModelPack provides a standardized format for packaging machine learning models, making it framework-agnostic and cloud-native. Whether you're using TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, or any other ML framework, ModelPack can help you package and distribute your models efficiently.

## Getting Started

To get started with ModelPack:

1. Visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/modelpack/model-spec)
2. Check out the [documentation](/docs/intro)
3. Join the community and contribute!

## CNCF Sandbox Project

We're proud to be part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a Sandbox project. This means we're committed to building open, interoperable, and community-driven solutions for the cloud-native ecosystem.
