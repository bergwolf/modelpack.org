# modelpack.org

Official website for the ModelPack project - a CNCF Sandbox project for standardized AI model packaging and distribution.

This website is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Local Development

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

The website is automatically deployed to Netlify when changes are pushed to the main branch.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see the [model-spec repository](https://github.com/modelpack/model-spec) for contribution guidelines.
